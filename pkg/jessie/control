Description: Relay for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) media streams
 A high-performance media relay for RTP streams that can work together
 with SIP Express Router, OpenSER or Sippy B2BUA. Its main use is to
 support SIP user agents behind NAT, but it can also act as a generic media
 relay.
 .
 The main purpose of RTPproxy is to make the communication between SIP
 user agents behind NAT(s) (Network Address Translator) possible. Several
 cases exists when direct end-to-end communication is not possible and
 RTP streams have to be relayed through another host. The RTPproxy can
 be used to setup such a relaying host. 
 .
 Originally created for handling NAT scenarious it can also act as a
 generic media relay as well as gateway RTP sessions between IPv4 and
 IPv6 networks. It can also perform number of additional functions,
 including call recording, playing pre-encoded announcements, real-time
 stream copying and RTP payload reframing.
